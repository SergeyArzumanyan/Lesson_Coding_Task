# Instructions For Brevity

To run this task and test it

- Run npm start

```bash
    npm run start
```

This will build the `.ts` file and execute it, to change the path of the folder

- Change the `passedPath` argument of the function in  `src/app.ts` file
- After that run `npm start` again

Thank you
